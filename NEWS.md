# ssrhom 0.0.3

* Model updates:
  * Separate phase thresholds for ordinal models
  * Ordinal thresholds now based on splines
* Can now analyze a single case -- loss of hierarchical modeling benefits
* Added log-odds ratio for data in [0, 1]
* Ensured log-rate ratio only computed for non-negative data

# ssrhom 0.0.2

* Updated model to permit separate case-wise and treatment phase variances, fixed variance of case 1 control to 1.

# ssrhom 0.0.1

* Analysis and effect sizes for AB designs
* Tests implemented
* README is slightly useful
* On R-universe
